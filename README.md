# Good for PoC

Good for PoC is creating a list of inclusive companies for people of color in tech. It was founded by Amélie Lamont, Catt Small and Jacky Alciné. After running for a year by ourselves, we realized we needed help. This project is now open source. Please [view the roadmap](https://github.com/GoodForPoC/GoodForPoC/projects/1) to understand what kinds of contributions we are looking for.
